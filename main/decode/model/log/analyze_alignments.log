The optional-silence phone sil occupies 43.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 56.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.3 hours of data, or 0.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,15.6,46)
