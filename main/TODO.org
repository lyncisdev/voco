You can create a .desktop file in your /home/user/Desktop/ directory that looks like this:

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Voco
Comment=Run Voco
Exec=python /home/bartek/Projects/ASR/voco/main/record_decode.py
Icon=/home/bartek/Projects/ASR/voco/main/icon.png
Path=/home/bartek/Projects/ASR/voco/main/
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;Application;

This the user must be owner of this file and the executable permission must be set, see my example:

example .desktop file

AndO here the file:

user@host:~# ls -la /home/user/Desktop/firefox.desktop
-rwx------ 1 user user 9177 Dec 27 08:27 /home/user/Desktop/firefox.desktop
