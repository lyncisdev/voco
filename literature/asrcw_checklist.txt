--- Check list for ASR coursework submission ---
 Check the following items shown with [].

- Report format
  [] Both studentâ€™s UUNs (e.g. s1234567) are clearly shown at the top of
     the report.
  [] Your names are NOT shown in the report.
  [] Your report should be either a PDF (.pdf) or MS Word (.doc[x])
     document, with a double-column format. 

- Report submission
  [] The file name of your report should be either report.pdf or report.doc[x].
  [] The report is submitted by only one student (not both) in your pair,
     with the submit command. 
         e.g.  submit asr 1 report.pdf

- Information of partner
  [] The file 'partner' in your WorkDir has been created, and it
     contains the UUN of your partner, and it does not contain the
     name of the partner.
     This applies to both the students in your pair.
     In case you work alone, you still need to create the file, and
     indicate 'none' or leave it empty.

- Submission of your ASR systems (i.e. script files)
  [] All the scripts shown below are stored in 'my-local' in the
     WorkDir of the student who submits the report.
  [] Scripts contain sufficient code for the marker to replicate the
     experiment you report in your report.
  Task 1.1:
     [] exp_mono_t1.sh
     [] run_mono_t1_best.sh
  Task 1.2:
     [] exp_mono_t2.sh
  Task 1.3:
     [] exp_mono_t3.sh
  Task 1.4:
     [] exp_mono_t4.sh
  Task 2.1:
     [] exp_tri_t1.sh
     [] run_tri_t1_best.sh
  Task 3:
     [] your scripts for Task 3
     [] The file names of the scripts are clearly indicated in your report.
