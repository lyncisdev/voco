Slide 52 "1. Likelihood: how to calcuate?"
  I forgot to explain how P(X,path_\ell | \lambda) is calculated at
  the lecture. Please read carefully the first three lines of mathmatical
  expressions just under the figure (HMM trellis) to understand the following.
  (NB: I'm using Latex notation below)
  Line 1:
    P(X,path_\ell | \lambda) can be factorised into the product of
    P(X|path_\ell,\lambda) and  P(path_\ell|\lambda).
  Line 2:
    The path_\ell, which is shown as the red lines in the figure,
    denotes the sequence of states:
         s_0, s_1, s_1, s_1, s_2, s_2, s_3, s_3, s_4
  Line 3:
     The first term on the right hand side of the equation at Line 2
     is given as the product of emission probabilities (pdfs to be
     strict): b_1(x_1) b_2(x_2)....b_3(x_7),
     and the second term is given as the product of a_{01}... a_{34}.
